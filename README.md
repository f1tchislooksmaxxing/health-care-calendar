anothertestcalendar.py has the actual code for the whole calendar which works and the __init__.py is a code for the tkinter which helps to use several windows, as you supposed to use when youchoose a day on calendar, tkinter opens a window where you can write your ideas and things, however several unlnown errors happened and visual code studio cant show where and what exact problem is so i just left these two and the first one can open the calendar itself. Free for use and if possible you can try to fix but thats for the project.
